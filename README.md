# Sorting algorithms
This project was done as a class project for the following class:
Data Structures and Algorithms (INFO0902-1)  

It implements several sorting algorithms in C.

Grades:
* Code: 19/20
* Report: 17/20
* Overall: 18/20

### Running
First, compile:  
`gcc -o sorting main.c Array.c <Sort>.c`  
Replace <Sort> by the algorithm you want to try amongst the following:
* HeapSort.c
* InsertionSort.c
* QuickSort.c
* PlaceSort.c
* RecSort.c


Then, run:  
`./sorting`

### Report
